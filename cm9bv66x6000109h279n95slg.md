Two decades ago, something incredible happened in the world of software development—and it all started with just 10 days of furious coding.

In 2005, Linus Torvalds—already famous for creating the Linux kernel—set out to solve a very personal and practical problem. The Linux kernel community needed a new version control system. The proprietary tool they had been using, BitKeeper, was no longer an option. Rather than adopt an existing alternative, Torvalds decided to build something new. And fast.

The result? Git.

What started as a quick workaround to manage one of the most complex open-source projects on Earth would go on to redefine how developers write, collaborate on, and deploy code.

## **Why Git? Why Now?**

In a recent candid interview, Torvalds revisited Git’s early days and reflected on its evolution. His motivations were pragmatic—he needed speed, reliability, and the ability to work offline. At the time, most version control systems were centralized and painfully slow. They didn’t scale well, and they definitely weren’t built with distributed development in mind.

Git flipped that model on its head.

“I wanted a system that mirrored the way Linux development already worked: distributed, fast, and with full history available locally,” Torvalds explained.

So he built it. In just 10 days.

## **A Tool Born from Frustration**

The initial prototype of Git wasn’t perfect, but it was fast and functional. Linus handed it off to the community almost immediately—and that’s when things really took off.

Developers around the world began contributing, refining the system, and building a rich ecosystem around it. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket emerged, layering collaboration features on top of Git’s core functionality and opening the door for millions of developers to contribute to open source.

Suddenly, you didn’t need to be part of a big company or a core team to be part of something bigger. You could fork a repo, make a pull request, and be part of a global conversation. Git democratized code collaboration.

## **Philosophy in Code**

What makes Git so enduring isn’t just its speed or distributed model—it’s the philosophy it embodies.

Git respects developers. It doesn’t try to hide complexity, but it gives you powerful tools to manage it. It trusts you to know what you’re doing (and lets you dig yourself into a hole if you’re not careful). It’s raw, fast, and infinitely flexible.

Sure, there’s a learning curve. But once you “get” Git, you unlock a whole new way of thinking about code. Branching isn’t a hassle—it’s a superpower. History isn’t lost—it’s preserved, immutable, and always accessible.

## **20 Years Later: Git in 2025**

Today, Git powers everything from personal side projects to enterprise-scale applications. It’s used by hobbyists and billion-dollar tech giants alike. It underpins the open-source movement and serves as the backbone of developer collaboration in nearly every modern team.

Twenty years after its creation, Git isn’t just a version control system—it’s a piece of infrastructure that has reshaped the software industry.

## **Looking Ahead**

What’s next for Git? As the world of development continues to evolve—more automation, AI-assisted coding, cloud-native architectures—Git remains foundational. And while new tools and abstractions may come and go, the core principles of Git continue to influence how we build and share code.

So here’s to the weird little tool Linus Torvalds built in 10 days. It wasn’t meant to be a revolution, but it became one anyway.
